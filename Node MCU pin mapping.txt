NOTEs: 

You have 9 Usable OUTPUT pins: GPIO  0,2,4,5, 12,13,14, 15,16.
These are the D0,D1,D2...D8 pins.

You have 7 Usable INPUT pins : GPIO  0,2,4,5, 12,13,14.
NOTE: D0 (GPIO 16) cannot be used for input on Node MCU.
When using GPIO 15 for input, remember it has a built-in pull down. So internal 
pull up is not there.

In addition, GPIO 3 (Rx) can be used as input/output if serial port is not used.
NOTE: Rx takes 6.5 mA when low. This is higher then the other input pins.
GPIO 1 (Tx) cannot be used for I/O as there are default messages flowing out.

Special notes on GPIO 0, 2 and 15:

GPIO 0,2 and 15 decide the startup mode. It is best to avoid them for
any I/O. If unavoidable, use appropriate pull up/ pull down resistors.

GPIO 0 is pulled high during normal operation, so you can’t use it as a Hi-Z input.
GPIO 2 can’t be low at boot, so you can’t connect a switch to it.

GPIO 0 is driven with some signal at startup. It stablilizes after 100 mSec.

When you take GPIO 2 LOW, its LED glows; the low input is also taken correctly. In 
this condition the current is 1.2 mA.
You don’t have to add an external pull-up resistor to GPIO2, the internal one is 
enabled at boot.

You cannot use GPIO 15 for input without external pullup; it is always LOW due to its
pull down resistor.

GPIO15 is always pulled low, so you can’t use the internal pull-up resistor. 
When using GPIO15 as an input to read a switch or connect it to a device with an 
open-collector output, like I2C.

GPIO 16 :

GPIO 16 is to be connected to RESET pin to come out of periodic sleep mode.
Do NOT use GPIO 16 for input; it takes 45 mA ! (due to the LED ?). The Pin is
rated only for 12 mA.

Never use GPIO 9 and 10 (SD3/ SD2), even though they are given Dx names. If you output
to them, the system crashes !
